# SimpleSnake

A simple C# implementtion of the classic game Snake.

SimpleSnake can be run either in a window, or as a Console application, depending on the arguments it is passed.  It makes use of the strategy pattern by defining an interface to its graphics output and user input code, and implementing this for both the C# Console and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
